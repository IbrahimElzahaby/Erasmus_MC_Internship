# Plasmidome investigations to address the main transfer route of anti-microbial resistance (AMR) genes in bacteria

This project aims to analyze large-scale genomic datasets (441,120 RefSeq plasmids) to annotate and discover the presence and absence of AMR genes. The analysis workflow underlying according to the following structure:

## Identify Inc types
plasmidfinder.py 

## Whole genome annotation
prokka

## Pan-Plasmidome investigation
panaroo

## Mass Screening of contigs for virulence genes
ABRicate

## AMR gene discovery
RGI




Note: This an ongoing project. The changes will be updated accordingly.
